Poker Quarantine is a web app where users can choose to bet money in a variety of online poker games played against other players, one example includes Texas Holdâ€™em. The betting system will be done with a dummy transaction system for this project, as there are legal complications for hosting a real gambling system.

## Objectives

The game is created mainly for entertainment purposes. Other online games exist that provide entertainment, but there are a few poker game websites that offer a variety of poker games. Additionally, with the recent quarantine, there are now many more addicted gamblers who have lost their nightly routine of playing games at their local casino due to the state of the world being under a pandemic. They can use the **Poker Quarantine** webapp to satisfy his gambling addiction and distract their mind from the thoughts of the current situation of the world burning down to the ground. However, we do not have to limit our targeted customer group to only addicted gamblers, but we can also include low-income but skilled players, as well as people of the legal age to gamble. 

Jason is an example of someone who has lost his nightly routine at the casino that will be using one **Poker Quarantine**. When he goes onto the website, he will be asked to log in to an existing account or create a new account to save and retrieve game data. He is then able to choose a specific poker game from a selection of poker games. He will be asked to purchase game currency with real money before he could start to play the game. After he obtains the minimum amount of currency, he will be able to play any game that he has selected against other real players, and potentially win or lose his currency. After each game, he will be able to chat with other users in the match. He will also be able to add them as friends and send them money/points/gifts to them.

Our project will feature a number of main features, mostly one for each potential poker game we are doing, as well as the main menu that allows a user to select which game they want to play, chat with others, keep track of their own points, and so forth.
